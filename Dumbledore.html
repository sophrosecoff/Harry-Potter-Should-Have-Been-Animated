<p>Book: Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Character: Harry Potter.</p>

<p>Because Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is the final book in the series its adaptation must be particularly effective. We judge endings far more harshly than we judge beginnings and middles because we are judging them against each of the previous books, not just the wider world of literature. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows had to live up to a lot. It needed to fulfill all of the characters’ arcs and resolve the unfinished plot lines. The world of the story needs to be forever changed by events that took place over the course of the book but the ending must also provide some sanctuary for its characters. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows also faced another challenge in providing a satisfactory conclusion. The main characters, the heroes of the series, are all young. Harry is seventeen and relatively average in all ways except circumstance. It is important that the events of the story feel like legitimate challenges and that the characters success in facing them feels correspondingly impressive. But it also detracts from the quality of the story if the characters are simply suddenly able to resolve the issues that they have been facing. If Harry were to face Voldemort again at the end of the seventh book and somehow manage to defeat him though he was unable to in the prior books it would be disappointing and unfulfilling for the reader.</p>

<p>The seventh book did a masterful job at achieving a conclusion that is satisfactory on all counts. Through a combination of Harry’s bravery and ability, and the circumstances put in place by himself and others, harry is able to defeat Voldemort without it seeming too easy for it to be satisfactory or too difficult for it to be believable within the context of the world and characters that were already set up. This was accomplished because the plot is incredibly intricate. There are layers of complexity that are put into place over the course of the series which take on greater meaning as the reader approaches the finale. The how, why and when these plot lines take on new meaning and importance corresponds with moments in the story that hold significant weight. For instance Harry’s death in the third act of Deathly Hallows is a thematic conclusion and resolution of a portion of Harry’s arc as a character and the events surrounding it are also significant to the mechanics of the plot. Voldemort, who lives, in part, because he chose to take Lilly’s sacrifice from Harry’s blood to his, chooses to kill Harry and Harry, the embodiment of that sacrifice, welcomes death so that his friends have a chance at survival. Lilly’s sacrifice, alive in Voldemort, tethers Harry to life and so he is given the opportunity to return and fight with his friends. In this moment the theme of sacrifice, one that has been woven throughout the series, sees its conclusion allowing the plot to move forward which now holds more weight all while increasing Harry’s odds against Voldemort thereby paving the way for a satisfactory conclusion. Later in the book Harry reveals to Voldemort, and the reader, that he is, and has been, the true master of the Elder Wand. It is never explicitly stated in the series, but this means that at the moment of his sacrifice a few chapters earlier, Harry was the maser of death. This allows for there to be unanswered questions once the book is finished, something that is widely considered to be a crucial component of literature with staying power. Do the deathly hallows actually make one the master of death? Would Harry have survived Voldemort’s curse if he had not possessed the deathly hallows? Would Lilly’s sacrifice residing Voldemort’s blood, alone, save him? He was given the choice to go ‘on’ rather than return, would he not have had that choice without possession of the deathly hallows? </p>

<p>A lot of the intricacies of these scenes are missing from the film. The movie aimed to keep the momentum going rather than sit and meditate with the real, quiet, stakes of the story. It is unfortunate that these moments were not brought to the screen because a visual medium has the power to strengthen the message. </p>

<p>The theme of death throughout the Harry Potter series, and the characters relationship to it, is so interesting because it is ever present. Often it is at the forefront of the plot and when it is not, it lingers in the characters thoughts and behaviors. Although it is not until the seventh book that the deathly hallows are introduced as a set they, the objects themselves and the philosophies that surround them, are littered throughout the series. Animation has the power to highlight this. Harry, Dumbledore and Voldemort are each defined by their relationship to the hallows. Each of them possessed, whether they knew it or not, one of the hallows for the entirety of the series. Dumbledore’s wand is the elder wand, Harry receives the cloak from his father (through Dumbledore) in book one, and Voldemort (unknowingly) turned the resurrection stone into a Horcrux while in school. Their possession of each of these items is incredibly important to their character. Harry is defined by protection, whether being protected by, or acting as a protector for those around him. The cloak, as Dumbledore says, is powerful because “it can be used to protect and shield others as well as its owner”. Dumbledore’s arc prior to the start of the series was him mending his relationship with power. His mastery of the Elder Wand symbolizes the conclusion of this arc. He becomes worthy of wielding such power just as he determines that he will never use it ““I had proven, as a very young man, that power was my weakness and my temptation. It is a curious thing, Harry, but perhaps those who are best suited to power are those who have never sought it. Those who, like you, have leadership thrust upon them, and take up the mantle because they must, and find to their own surprise that they wear it well... I was fit to own the Elder Wand, and not to boast of it, and not to kill with it. I was permitted to tame and to use it, because I took it, not for gain, but to save others from it.” Voldemort, though he is never, himself, aware of it, possessed the resurrection stone for much of the series. His possession of the stone is crucial because his greatest fear is death. He fears both dying himself and those that are already dead. He never loved so death was never something he mourned. Through his many atrocities he sent many to their death and, so, to him the resurrection stone would only give power to those he defeated. The lingering power of those that are no longer with us is ultimately what instigates his undoing. So, his ignorance to his own closeness with the resurrection stone is thematically significant. </p>

<p>When the deathly hallows are revealed to have significance in each of these characters lives it adds nuance to their character as they appear in the previous books. Animation would allow for this nuance to present visually on screen. The hallow that forms the closest link to the given character could inform that character’s design. The triangular shape of the Cloak would inform the way that harry carries himself. The wide stance of his feet with his skinny frame. Voldemort is gaunt and skeletal, the dead walking, a resurrected form himself. The shadowed hallow of his cheeks and the sharp sleek gleam of his white skin could take up the aesthetic of faceted jewel. Dumbledore, tall, thin, power exuding from him when he requires it, would fit the description of the elder wand. When surveying Harry in his iconic pose (elbows resting on his desk, the tips of his fingers pressed lightly together, his eyes peering over his half-moon spectacles) his hands and fingers could mirror the aesthetic as well. </p>

<p>Dumbledore and Harry’s relationship is so crucial a to the story. Dumbledore is a god-like figure to Harry. He is wise and caring but also, ultimately, cruel. Dumbledore knows all ends and he feels that he is the only one capable of acting so he sets the stage for Harry the only way that he knows will work. Throughout the seventh book Harry grows to distrust and even dislike Dumbledore. Dumbledore as a hero becomes tarnished. The conclusion of their relationship arc occurs when Harry stops seeing Dumbledore as a hero and is able to view the entirety of him. Harry and Dumbledore are the embodiment of goodness versus greatness. Harry is inherently good and Dumbledore is destined to be great. Harry’s forgiveness of Dumbledore solidifies this. Dumbledore’s legacy is secured through Harry’s acceptance of him and Harry overcomes his anger through forgiveness. They are each very complicated characters that need to be handled tenderly on screen. Dumbledore must be magisterial and stern, powerful and calm, eccentric and revered. He must always have twinkle in his eye and communicate with a sharp sort of subtly. When he is fighting it must both be casual, controlled and his power must visibly radiate across the screen. Those around him must be shown to be in awe of his presence but he must also dress in contrast to this respect. He wears colorful, glittering robes, healed boots with a large buckle and a watch with planets and moons dancing across it. He is a character with a lot of sorrow. He is very lonely and, like Harry, he craves death. Dumbledore’s relationship with death is different from Harry’s through. Dumbledore spends his life wishing to drag the dead back to him but when he diesm, he does so begging for death, longing to move on. Harry spends much of the series wishing he were dead. He hears voiced across the veil in the department of mysteries and longs to join them. The friends he chooses are so full of vibrancy and life but he, often, feels distant and separate from them. When given the choice to move on, though, he chooses to return. He overcomes his flirtation with death and learns that those he loved and lost can be with him even in life. Like the wife of the second brother, he walks through many of the books as a dead man among the living. His longing to be with the dead is betrayed by the stubborn bravery he inherited from James and Lilly, but always that longing is there. Harry overcomes his longing for death by choosing to return to life. Dumbledore overcomes his longing to bring the dead back to him by joining them.</p> 

<p>This dynamic should follow them throughout the series, long before it enters the plot. They should both be colored with the sorrow that is inherent to their characters. It should dictate the way they appear on screen. Dumbledore: wise and all knowing, Harry: good and worthy. </p>
