<p>Book: Harry Potter and the Halfblood Prince, Character: Ginny.</p>

<p>Harry Potter and the Halfblood Prince is the first book in the series that is truly dark. The loss of Dumbledore removes what seems to be Harry’s final layer of protection. The darkness exhibited throughout this book is inherently mature and requires an equally sophisticated portrayal on screen. Animation has historically been used for children’s media but this does not mean that the medium is incapable of mature sophistication of the variety that is required by the plot of Halfblood Prince. It is tempting to acheive this by attempting to replicate the visual tone of suffering within our world. To paint the screen with World War II colors and to darken every frame. But visual darkness and blood and the colors of war are not, alone, going to endear the audience to the suffering in the story. In the case of Harry Potter it is not the destruction of the world, as with war, that makes the story so dark. It is the destruction of the characters and what is left of their lives. This does not require a drab color pallet and live action sets and people. A major theme of the series is that the wizarding world starts as an escape for Harry. A place that is without the woes of the muggle world. Harry learns, as the story progresses, that, even among wizards, the world is unjust and cruel and work must be done to correct this. The dichotomy between the vibrancy and whimsy of the magical community and the very human, worldly injustice and prejudice inherent to their systems is important to the story. The later films do not have to look like a typical war movie (with the red of blood being the only source of color on an otherwise grey screen) in order for it to carry weight. All that matters is that the creators respect the art and the audience and that they allow the story to take its time, to be melancholy and to let the characters feel the weight of the plot with the audience. This can be done in any format, live action or animation.</p> 

<p>The other crucial component of the sixth Harry Potter book is the shifting and evolving of character dynamics. This is less flexible regarding medium. Characters and their relationships with one another can grow and change throughout a series of films in live action or animation but with animation the artist has more control. When the culmination of relationships is so very present as it is in Harry Potter and the Halfblood Prince an increased capacity to manipulate charter dynamics visually is crucial.</p>

<p>Ginny Weasley experiences the conclusion of her arc in this book. She grows throughout the previous books and continues to grow after, but it is within Harry Potter and the Halfblood Prince that her growth is at the forefront. In animation this growth can be demonstrated physically. As with Hermione and Harry the animators would have complete control over her features and how much she changes as she ages but they also have the power to change larger components of her character and personality as they manifest physically. In the real world we grow and change in relatively undemonstrative ways. The wasy inwhich Humans are similar are large and sweeping, we our diffidences are small. The opposite is wanted when demonstrating character dynamics. As ginny grows more confident and strong willed this can and should be realized in the way she is drawn. </p>

<p>In the film Wolfwalkers by Cartoon Saloon the sillouhette of the main character’s face in profile is the inverse of her father’s such that, when facing one another head on, they form two pieces of the same puzzle. Thematically this is used to symbolize two things throughout the film. In the first act, this component of their character's design is used to highlight that they go together, that they are a set. As the film progresses and a strain is placed upon their relationship, the distinction between them is highlighted The same design choice is used to emphasize the opposition of their nature. In Harry Potter this technique would add nuance to character relationships throughout the series, but particularly that of Harry and Ginny. At the start of the series the physical manifestation of Ginny’s character could simply not fit together with Harry’s. Young Ginny could mirror much of the physicality of young Harry, signifying her longing for him. While Harry is oblivious and unreciprocative of her affections. Meanwhile they are both slight and awkward and they have not grown into themselves yet. In the beginning when the two of them exhibit the same space it is an incomplete picture. As the series progresses and they each grow independently of one another they would return to find each other, both emotionally and physically, a match. When shown on screen in the same space they now fill the gaps left by the other. This does not need to be a dramatic demonstration but just subtleties in their aesthetics, Ginny has broad shoulders, sweeping hair: she headstrong and bold. Harry is slight with a wide confident stance: quiet and withdrawn but brave on his feet. Ginny stands tall and proud, her chest and shoulders pressed out, she holds her wand at eye level with both hands. Harry is more focused, he holds his wand by his side with one hand, the other extended in protection of those behind him. Together the frame is balanced by each of their presences. They grew independently into themselves and, unintentionally, into each other. This could be juxtaposed by Hemrione and Ron. The trio always fit together as a set. As they each grow their shapes are refined but in congruence with that of the others. The presence of the other two acts as a mold for each of them to grow within. Both their physical forms and that of their personality and character. As Ron and Hermione age they grow to fill each other’s empty spaces even without the presence of Harry. The three of them fit together as a set always, but Hermione and Ron no longer require Harry’s presence to balance them out on screen. Ron, tall gangling. Hermione, short and slightly hunched. Ron’s shoulders are rounded and his gate is wide so that he seems to surround her in comfort and an awkward sort of protection. </p>

<p>The physicality of Harry and Ginny could be used to fill another role in the story. A key element of Harry’s character is the way that his parents are reflected in him. He hears often of his resemblance to his father. “You look just like James but you have Lilly’s eyes”. Within the discourse surrounding ther Harry Potter series, it is often commented on that harry resembles his father and that Ginny bares many physical similarities to Harry’s mother. However, within the books, it is also mentioned that, though Harry looks so much like his father, his demeanor is that of his mother. Each of their personalities and their positions within each other’s lives are ultimately sort of the reverse of how they physically appear. As tumblr user cdrcdiggory puts it “Harry [has] nice eyes, will probably ruin your entire life with sarcastic one liners, normally pretty chill but has a temper that could kill a man, really wants to see the best in everyone, hated by Petunia for no fault of his own, raised without magic, Snape says he cares about his well-being but treats him like shit, kinda oblivious half the time, harnesses the power of love. Ginny [is a] pureblood Gryffindor w[ith] a 'blood traitor' family, star chaser, popular af and knows it, no chill, only cares what a very select group of people think, probably into bad puns, had a crush on Harry for years before it was reciprocated, secretly a giant nerd but will deny it to her death. In short, ginny is actually James and Harry’s Lilly, tbh”. Ginny’s physical appearance is most similar to Harry’s mother but her role is that of the James to Harry’s Lilly. So their small physical characteristics, the ones humans are most accustomed to noticing can be that of the character that they are described as most resembling but their silhouette and the way that they each carry themselves can reflect the character whose role they each manifest. The way that James walks and holds himself can be used to inform the way that Ginny moves throughout the screen, similarly Lilly’s mannerisms and motions can be reflected in Harry. When they accompany each other on screen they can fill the space, fit together, in the same way that Lilly and James do the few times we see them together. This is the sort of thing that would come across as weird and heavy handed if it were not just subtext and inference in literature but can be demonstrated tenderly with animation. This concept can also be used in more specific contexts. In Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone we see Harry interact with his parents through the Mirror of Erised. Lilly is described as “smiling but crying” as she waves to Harry. James places his arm around her in comfort. This interaction could be replicated in the final scene of the series when Harry and Ginny bid their children farewell as they leave on the Hogwarts express. Harry, who did not grow up experiencing this kind of farewell, with tears in his eyes: waving, smiling but crying. Ginny with a comforting arm around him, mirroring the interaction between Harry's parents and him at the start of the series. It would act as both a bookend to his growth as a character and would mark the culmination of his relationship arc with Ginny. </p>
