<p>Book: Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Character: Harry Potter.</p>

<p>Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone is the most blatantly cartoonish of the series. Within the first few chapters, men and women dressed in garish robes stroll through central London, owls swoop through the city in broad daylight and a giant man who rides a flying motorbike blasts his way into the Dursley’s dilapidated island cabin. And this is all without mention of the contributions of the book’s primary character. Even before reaching Hogwarts, Harry, albeit unintentionally, performs magic in a number of absurd and whimsical ways. He mistakenly turns his teacher’s wig blue, he unintentionally floats onto the roof of his school to escape Dudley and his gang, he speaks to a boa constrictor and shrinks an ugly old sweater of Dudley’s into doll clothes as his aunt tries to force it over his head. Each of these instances bare the unmistakable signs of cartoonish fun. Even as the story progresses and mature themes such as love, loss and death enter the text, Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone with its classic Scooby-Doo style plot twist fits squarely within the audience’s preconceived notion of what aught to be animated. If the series had stopped after book one and (perhaps) even book two, there is a good chance that any adaption would have been animated. But by 2001, when the first Harry Potter movie was released, four of the novels had already been published and the darker tones demonstrated throughout the following books lulled the filmmakers into choosing a live action format. </p>

<p> Beyond the cartoonish imagery exhibited in the book’s introduction, there are many components of the story and its characters that lend well to an animated medium. Philosopher’s Stone is a piece of blatantly children’s literature. The narrative and language understands and respects its audience but, ultimately there is no confusion as to who this audience is intended to be: children. Stating that its adaptation would  have been better animated is not, perhaps, as outlandish a proclamation as it would be for the rest of the series. It is still, however, worth looking at what specifically was lost when translating the text to the screen and what could be gained with an artful animated rendition. </p>

<p>The plot of Harry Potter is incredibly intricate, especially as the series progresses. It is dense with characters, subplots, and repeating themes and ideas. From book one there are certain elements that, although they are sometimes shadowed by the specific moments of the story, are integral components of what makes the series good and are crucial within the context of the completed narrative of the series. Love, friendship, loyalty and sacrifice are all woven into the text. They are values which are upheld by individual characters but are also integrated into the very workings of the world that the characters are placed within. Harry survives because his mother sacrifices herself to save him. Lilly was given the option to step aside and spare herself but she chose to stand between her son and his demise. The value of sacrifice is embodied by Lilly, the first hero of the story, but its importance is also denoted by the magic inherent to world surrounding her. Lilly did not know that standing between her son and Voldemort would offer Harry protection after she was gone, she simply made the choice to trade her own life to add a few seconds to Harry’s. This pure, complete, visceral, comprehensive, unconditional love for her son, the simple fact that she would give up the entirety of herself for one more moment for him, culminated in a form of protective magic surrounding Harry even after she was gone. Lilly did not intentionally cast a spell on Harry, the power of this sacrifice is something that is inherent to the magic woven into the world of Harry Potter. Harry inherited this protection from his mother, but it was ultimately the universe that bestowed it upon him and kept her sacrifice alive thereby establishing sacrifice and goodness as valuable within the context of their world.</p> 

<p>The story is ultimately about the inherent power of agency. The book is saturated with magic of all kinds but its most important form is this more subtle form of magic: choices. Lilly choses to die protecting Harry and so this protection lingers. In the end of the series Harry mirrors and amplifies this sacrifice by dying for his friends. Voldemort represents the inverse of Lilly and Harry’s sacrificial magic. He chooses to sacrifice others to gain power for himself. By taking Harry’s blood to reform his body he manipulates the pure and good sacrifice of Lilly into adding another layer of protection around him. This ultimately leads to his undoing. Each of these characters, intentionally or not, are manipulating life and death to achieve their ends. Lilly and Harry with their self sacrifice for those they love and Voldemort with the sacrifice of others to guard his own immortality. </p>

<p>Harry makes thousands of choices throughout the series. Some crucial to the plot and all crucial to his character. When asked to make a decision about who to befriend by Draco, harry chooses Ron, thereby cementing him as the embodiment of what Harry wants and likes. He essentially chooses between ambition, power and greed and home, goodness, and family. Throughout the series Harry chooses Ron again and again. This is brought to the forefront of the text in the later books when their relationship is strained but every moment with Ron as his best friend is a choice he is making. When The Mirror of Erised reveals Harry’s heart’s deepest desire, it proves the totality of this decision by demonstrating the purity of Harry’s heart. Harry sees himself with his family, complete and happy. The very quality that drew him to Ron and the Weasleys. Choosing Ron and Hermione as his friends does not invoke some hidden magical protection in the series in the same way that his sacrifice for their benefit does later on, but his desire to align himself with people who are good and pure protects him from being seduced by the temptations of dark magic that are presented to him through his connection with Voldemort. Through this connection, he has the opportunity to tap into very powerful forms of magic but is not tempted by them. His parents death imbues him with both protection, the desire for revenge and an intrinsic alignment with that magic which is good, the kind that they embodied and that which is represented with every choice he makes throughout the series. It is with the spell expeliarmus, the least damaging of defensive magic, that he ultimately defeats the greatest instance of evil. This spell holds more power for Harry against Voldemort because of the culmination of each of their choices throughout the series. Harry’s commitment to those decisions that reflect goodness: loyalty, love and sacrifice and Voldemort’s repeated chooses which are rooted malice: individualism, power, and the bargaining of others.</p>

<p>Harry Potter tells the very real story of the value of every decision we make and the exponential power of routine, making the same choice again, doubling down on our beliefs. The narrative highlights and empowers this with the fantastical element of magic. Still, choice is an inherently human thing. The power to defy instinct is unique to mankind. Magic is not the most crucial component of the story that is being told. A story’s most compelling ideas are the ones that hold universal truth. </p>

<p>This is a very delicate theme and it is inherently driven by characters. The book is defined by the agency of those that make up the story. The choices made by every individual that contributes to the plot must fully reflect and demonstrate their character and values. This requires a sophisticated portrayal of each of the story’s primary characters, particularly Harry. And Harry is an incredibly complicated character to play. He is inherently good. He is earnest and innocent and is the full embodiment and culmination of his parent’s sacrifice. But he is also a very angry character. This is something that is often commented on and it is true, for much of the series he is full of angst and anger. But it is righteous anger. This is a very difficult part for any actor to portray, but especially one as young as Harry is throughout the series and, especially, at the start. But it is also crucial that Harry be young. At eleven even a year makes a huge difference in maturity and demeanor. Harry must have the mannerisms and physical appearance of someone who is as young as he is intended to be. But even if an eleven-year-old actor were able to capture the complexities of Harry’s character, he would outgrow the role. Each installment of the series would inevitably require more than a year to produce and, even if Harry’s actor could reflect all that was asked of him, he would become a man too soon. With animation the actor could be older. An actor that is exactly Harry’s age for every moment of the films/series is no longer a requirement. And he would be cast on his ability to portray Harry’s character alone, not based on his physical appearance. In addition the representation of the physical manifestations of his emotions would land with the animators, not the actor. This would provide infinite flexibility. Every moment could be manipulated to fully encompass the complex entirety of Harry’s, and every character’s, personality. This enables their choices and motives, which are so crucial to the mechanics and gravity of the plot, to be fully embodied and reflected by them.</p>

<p>Chapter 12: The Mirror of Erised</p>

<blockquote><p>“He looked in the mirror again. A woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling at him and waving. He reached out a hand and felt the air behind him. If she was really there, he’d touch her, their reflections were so close together, but he felt only air — she and the others existed only in the mirror.</p>

<p>She was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair and her eyes — her eyes are just like mine, Harry thought, edging a little closer to the glass. Bright green — exactly the same shape, but then he noticed that she was crying; smiling, but crying at the same time. The tall, thin, black-haired man standing next to her put his arm around her. He wore glasses, and his hair was very untidy. It stuck up at the back, just as Harry’s did.</p>

<p>Harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching that of his reflection.</p>

<p>‘Mum?’ he whispered. ‘Dad?’</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily back at them, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them. He had a powerful kind of ache inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness.”</p></blockquote>

<p></p>

<p>This scene is highly demonstrative of Harry’s character. He is innocent but also hungry. He exhibits righteous greed and longing. There is such a fine line that needs to be tread in order for an actor to bring this to life.  He is innocent but bears tremendous trauma, he is curious and mischievous but his curiosity has extended into longing. He does not want a family, he craves one. It is not a wish but a desire. This longing and hunger in his voice and face is absolutely missing from the films.</p>

<p>This scene translates incredibly well through text and bringing it to the screen has the potential to weaken it significantly but it also has the potential to enhance certain elements of this moment. In this scene Harry’s closeness to the mirror is brought to forefront of the readers mind: “Harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching that of his reflection” this could be demonstrated in any visual medium but if it were animated, the artist could demonstrate not just Harry’s closeness to the mirror, but also heighten the distance between him and his reflected self, the one whose parents are by his side. As he reaches out and steps closer, his reflected self would mirror his motions but they would always be separated by more than glass. Harry moves closer and closer to the mirror but his query remains, always, just out of reach. In a live action setting this warping and distortion of perspective would be clinical and distracting, it would not meld seamlessly into the narrative as it would with animation. This is also the sort of addition that works better visually than in the text. If the narrator went out of their way to describe a situation like this it would lose the subtly necessary to its success.</p>
