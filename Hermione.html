<p>Book: Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Character: Hermione Granger.</p>

<p>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is steeped with wizarding culture. Fred and George begin experimenting with Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes, the Death Eaters and The Dark Mark are elaborated on, with the addition of Alastor Moody, Rita Skeeter, Victor Krum, Cedric Diggory, Cho Chang, Fleur Delacour, Winky the House-elf and many others, the cast of characters is bigger than ever before, and, through the Quidditch World Cup and the TriWizard Tournament, the audience is introduced to wizards from all around the world. Each of these components are crucial to the story’s quality. Much of the actual plot of Goblet of Fire is unclear until the story’s resolution. This strategy makes for a highly satisfying climax and conclusion for a story but makes it suceptible to being un-engaging throughout. In the case of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire the story was able to entertain and satisfy at every stage because of the presence of world building and quality subplots. A mistake that is easy to make when converting a story as dense as this one to the screen is the removal of many of these key moments in favor of the overarching story that works to deliver the audience through to the next book. The Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire film did a lot of this. The removal of S.P.E.W. and of the majority of the scenes where characters attend class (particularly Hagrid’s Care of Magical Creatures lessons) takes the focus away from what makes the story truly great: the characters and the things that most interest them. Most of these moments were removed to keep the film's runtime down.</p>

<p>This is an issue regardless of the selected medium. It could be solved by converting the books to a mini series (with one season per book) rather than a series of seven or eight movies, or simply by adjusting the priorities of the film (i.e. less dramatic entrances and montages, and more moments with individual characters). While medium is relatively unimportant in determining how much to include from book to film it is crucial to consider when determining what moments make it to screen and how they are incorporated. The live action Harry Potter films incorporate many of the Weasley twins’ creations but the most iconic and inventive of them were, in many cases, left out. Their Canary Creams (a pastry that temporarily covers you in a feathery canary-shaped shell), Ton, Tongue, Toffee (a candy that causes the consumer’s tongue to change color and lengthen until it extends across the floor) and the Weasleys’ Portable Swamp (relatively self explanatory, I guess) were all left out of the film. This is likely due to a combination of the production costs of achieving the desired effect and the relative absurd and distracting nature of the product should they have ended up on screen. The issue is, the Wizarding World is an inherently absurd and distracting place. Still the filmmakers understood a key limitation of live action filmmaking: there is a limit to the audience’s suspension of disbelief. In animation both of these issues are automatically resolved. It does not cost particularly more to animate unrealistic and absurd moments than it does to draw any number of real world concepts, and the disbelief of the audience is suspended to a significantly greater degree just by the nature of it being a cartoon.</p>
 
<p>The more complicated component to incorporate is characters and culture. Within the context of a fictional, magical community, this, too, can be done more effectively and with more finesse through animation. The magical community needs to feel like it came about organically, as with all cultures, but it also needs to feel like it is intrinsically un-muggle. The modern Wizarding World (as with the modern real world) is a product of wars, innovation, oppression and collaboration. On screen it needs to feel, at the same time, familiar and foreign. Throughout the books the audience is able to surmise that wizards once lived openly with muggles but, due to persecution, went into hiding. The date that the Statute of Secrecy went into effect, though never plainly stated, had a profound effect on the development of the Wizarding community, in Europe and abroad. Hogwarts and many of the places and things that the characters interact with throughout the series feel medieval. It seems that Wizarding architecture and inventions were, for a long time, altered and magic-ified versions of contemporary muggle technologies. When the Statute of Secrecy came into effect (long before the start of the series) wizards were irrevocably distanced from muggles, their communities and their creations. As a result the Wizarding World during the lives of Harry and his friends is made up of those inventions and architecture of when the Statute of Secrecy first came into effect cobbled together with modern magic. The result is flying broomsticks, a castle that  come to life, and fire as the only source of non-magic light. Only Arthur Weasley (with his affinity for modern muggles) thinks to alter a modern vehicle with magic, for the rest of the wizarding community, progress is slow. </p>

<p>Fashion and beauty standards among wizards needs to fit seamlessly within this narrative. Witches and Wizards have had hundreds of years to evolve entirely different trends form those exhibited by the muggle community. Muggles create fashion trends to distance themselves and their community from those around them. The fashion of wizards and witches likely evolved, in part, as a way to differentiate themselves from muggles and to identify one another. The pointed hat and cloak that has been used a the symbol for witches and witchcraft since the concept first originated has become heighten through the ages. And, in the modern Wizarding World (with magic being taught and used outside of mere necessity) within isolated communities (like Hogwarts, Hogsmead and Godric’s Hallow) magic is likely imbedded into the very fabric of at least their formal wizarding attire. </p>

<p>In the films characters are rarely dressed in wizard’s robes. In the books it is rare that they are in muggle clothes. Take the Yule Ball for example. In the films many of the female characters either wore what were essentially muggle dresses, a little strange in design, but essentially muggle attire. The men wore suit-like robes. It is hard to do much else when working with real materials within a world made up of physical laws and gravity. In animation, fabric can lay and flow and behave in unique and interesting ways. Describing this within the books would take up valuable page space. On screen,  it would not take time away from the story to have Fleur’s silver dress robes flow like satin but glitter and shine like a jewel, to have Pansy’s pink frills bloom and rustle as she walks, to have the length of Cho’s sleeves meld seamlessly into the fabric of her skirt, to have someone’s robes flow like water and pool at their feet and to have the fabric of each of their robes extend and twirl about them as they dance. Beyond just aesthetics all of this has the potential to magnify what truly makes the scene at the Yule Ball great: Hermione. </p>

<p>For Hermione, animation best serves her character for very practical reasons. Physically, the changes she undergoes are particularly important to her growth as a character and to the story as a whole. Hermione grows and changes in a lot of ways throughout the fourth book, both her personality and her physical presence. It is in this book that she first campaigns for House-elf rights, that her unmatched ability to ignore taunts and bullying is brought to the forefront, and that her friendship with Ron starts to become romantic. All of these are encapsulated in her attendance at the Yule Ball. She is able to put aside her views on the enslavement of House-elves to allow herself a night of fun (something she had yet to do), she stuns Malfoy into silence (refusing to allow him to ruin her evening), and she confronts Ron over his jealous treatment of her. This is also the first time that she chooses to be beautiful within the context of the standards set up around her. She puts effort into dolling herself up for the night. This moment, in contrast with how she presents herself throughout the rest of the series, holds a lot of weight. It cements her chosen aesthetic, whatever that is in the moment, as entirely her choice. In live action films, generally, they cast movie starts. Emma Watson was never an ugly duckling so this scene is inherently less transformative and, therefore, less monumental. In addition there are certain practical components of the scene that are simply impossible to pull off without using animation. In the books, Hermione’s two front teeth are too big for her until she has them magically adjusted shortly before the Yule Ball. In live action, though it was not in the films, this could be achieved with a prosthetic. But the position and size of the teeth in a persons mouth effects the shape of their face in a way that is impossible to replicate. Her teeth before and after they are adjusted need to meld with the rest of her. With animation, the design of Hermione’s face could be slightly adjusted to accommodate this change.</p>

<p>The choice to change her teeth is important to her arch as a character. It is the first, and last, time she makes a choice entirely out of a desire for a cosmetic change. There is a certain amount of maturity in doing this. The way she presents herself at the Yule Ball goes against the way that she manifests her identity in the earlier books. Choosing to overtly and suddenly attempt to come across as beautiful to those around you when, before, you openly elected not to do so, is brave. It is entirely likely that Malfoy Crabbe and Goyle would have laughed at her attempt and found something to criticize. still, she made the decision just the same.</p>

<p>The specific characteristics of the outfit  Hermione wears to the Yule Ball is not made expressly clear in the books. This leaves room for artistic liberties when bringing the chapter to film. As long as the spirit and intent of the scene remains, the specifics are unimportant. She is described as wearing “periwinkle blue robes”, however the scene would hold even more magnitude if,  instead of robes, she wore a muggle dress to wizard prom. She would still make herself beautiful according to societal standards but she would do it on her terms. She would own her muggle identity and still manage to dazzle among witches and wizards. While everyone else is in gowns that flow and twirl and disobey the laws of the physical world, she would be in the center, dressed in a beautiful, simple, muggle dress, but; because she is dressed in contrast to both her normal self and the spectacle of everyone else, she would draw the eye of everyone in the room. </p>

<p>Hermione grows and changes a lot throughout the books. With animation, she could physically grow and change exactly as described. The scenes where her looks are important could hold magnitude in exactly the ways that are necessary in order for the  desired effect to be clear. The changes she undergoes would meld seamlessly into her evolving character design. Animation would also allow the aesthetic of the individual physical characteristics of the magical community to form a comprehensive world that surrounds Hermione and the other characters. A world whose boundaries (those between the individual components of the world that form the whole and between the world itself and the characters) are only as firm as is necessitated by the particular moment of the story.</p>
