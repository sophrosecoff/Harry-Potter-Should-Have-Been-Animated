<p>Book: Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Character: Luna Lovegood.</p>

<p>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix introduces many of the most iconic characters from the Harry Potter series. Animation would best adapt each of these new characters. Toad-like Umbrage, Demonic Kreacher and Metamorphmagus Tonks are all, quite plainly, best suited for the animated medium. The juxtaposition of Umbrage’s girly pink frills and her cruel vindictive nature would best come to life in a world drawn by hand. Kreacher, who is the first symbol of house-elf rights to Harry, would look just as lifelike as the human characters and, therefore, call for sympathy. Tonks would be given ample tools and flexibility to transform her aesthetic at will making her Metamorphmaging more believable and organic.</p>
    
<p>Luna Lovegood is also first introduced in this book. Throughout the series she is a source of entertainment for Ron and disagreement for Hermione. For Harry, she acts as a sort of angel. She is the first person of his age that Harry has ever met who, like him, is marred by the presence of death. She is better able to cope with, and is much more well adjusted to, the loss of her mother in comparison to Harry. But, ultimately, she is still a witness to much of the trauma that he is all too familiar with. There are many moments in this and the following book where Harry hears her words of comfort but is reluctant to take them seriously as he is highly skeptical of much of her worldview. Still, she provides a strange sort of solace to him when he is struggling most. But there is also a tragedy inherent to her character that is completely missing from the films.</p>

<p>When Harry visits Luna’s home in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows there is a short moment that is more evocative of her character than any other. “There was a large photograph beside the bed, of a young Luna and a woman who looked very like her. They were hugging. Luna looked rather better-groomed in this picture than Harry had ever seen her in life.” It is a short and seemingly insignificant quote thrown into a scene that holds weight in a thousand other ways. But the description of her by her mother’s side looking “better-groomed” than Harry had ever seen her holds an echo of the tragedy Luna faced in loosing her mother. </p>

<p>So much of Luna’s beloved character can be seen in her father. They are both ethereal and strange. They share many of the same absurd views and they genuinely love and take care of one another. The reader learns little about Luna’s mother. Her character can only be derived by the mark she left on, and the absence that surrounds Luna. All of the pieces of Luna that are not reflected in her father likely stem from her mother so the audience is able to ascertain a shadow of character. Luna’s mother was brave, empathetic to a fault, loyal and indignant. But what is of more significance is the vacancy Luna inherited through her mother’s death. Luna is a somewhat feral character for all the time Harry has known her. She is unkempt and a free spirit, even when she aught not to be. the description of her looking “rather better-groomed” when she had her mother with her screams of the loss of her only nurturer. Her father keeps her fed, tends to her wounds, loves her, is there with her through it all but her mother was the one who kept her hair clean, her clothes mended and dealt with the day to day drudgery of keeping taking care of a child. Luna will be fine. She is strong and her father is enough for her. But there is inherent tragedy in even the most charming of her characteristics as they ring of the loss that likely brought them into being. </p>

<p>Luna does not appear in the films as she is described in the books. Evanna Lynch captured much of her ethereal and eccentric nature but the portrayal lacked a lot of the visual tragedy associated with it. Luna must appear feral and unkempt in order for her character to come fully to a visual medium. But in live action, if this were pursued, it would come across as alarming. With animation the rough edges of her character could be pushed further without the audience wishing to call Child Protective Services. Her tangled mass of dirty hair, her robes (ill-fitting, ripped in places, knotted about her knees, for some reason white instead of the mandated black of the rest of school’s uniforms), and the dirty soles of her bare feet as she traipses through the castle grounds could meld with the more innocuous aesthetic of her character. This would allow for these choices to come across as unconcerning until they are brought to the forefront of the viewer’s mind later in the story. </p>

<p>Many of the characters throughout Harry Potter are on the verge of caricature. This is important because they each stress a different ideal that is weaved meticulously into the plot but it also has the potential to lend to an unsatisfactory live action performance. Many of the cast members of the Harry Potter franchise are rightfully admired (particularly the adult actors) but it is easy to heighten the specifics of the character until they are difficult to watch interact seriously on screen and the films fell into this multiple throughout. With animation there is more freedom to push certain characteristics without defying or altering the expectation for the genre. Animation is considered a genre in and of itself despite the fact that medium alone says nothing explicit about the plot. A positive consequence is that, with animation, there is no mold to break within the context of story. An animated production is inherently malleable and the creators have all of the freedoms associated with that. Luna and all of the other characters could be brought to the screen in their complete entirely without reckoning with the associations inherent to character acting in a live action format. </p>
