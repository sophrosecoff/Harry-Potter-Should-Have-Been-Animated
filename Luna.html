<p>Book: Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Character: Harry Potter.</p>

<p>Philosopher’s stone is the most blatantly cartoonish. It feels vibrant and youthful and virtually any reader would consider animation as a potential medium for adapting it. Harry turns his teachers wig blue, sets a boa constrictor on his cousin, magics a sweater to shrink until it no longer fits over his head to avoid wearing it. Their is a magic flying motorbike, a giant man a singing wizards hat a scooby doo plot twist. A man with two faces, one covered by a turban. Ron has a comically long nose, Dumbledore’s nose is also long and crooked (cartoonilly). Many of the characters are described as not compiling to beauty standards. Audiences are turned off by ugliness in live action movies but we cut cartoon characters some slack. Their robes have hoods that stick straight up, this would look silly in live action. They aren’t given explicit uniforms and, in fact, it is never made clear if they wear anything under their robes. This would not fly in a live action portrayal, so much so that they nixed the wizards robes after movie 2 and put them primarily in muggle clothing: a huge loss to the whimsy of the story but widely considered good direction as it aids in suspending the audiences disbelief. The story has dark themes but is, ultimately, a piece of blatantly children’s literature. A piece which values the child’s intellect and trusts and respects them. Offering mature themes without denying its fixture as children’s literature. It is much like Charlotte’s Web; mortality and death are major themes but is clearly intended for children. Not just children’s literature that happens to contain these themes, or literature with these themes that happens to be suitable for children, but literature intended for children and intended to deal with death and mortality with grace and respect for the intended reader. If the series had ended after book one it would have almost certainly been animated, as charlotte’s web was. Most people agree that the original, animated, Charlotte’s Web was superior to the live action remake (a genre that is almost universal scorned in general). We learned that animation is not a last resort when a studio lacks the resources to produce effective live action content for a given piece, but an art form in and of itself which accomplishes something unattainable by any other medium. It’s not hard to argue that sorcerer’s stone should have been animated, it is goofy and innocent and whimsical and much of that was the first to be removed on the cutting room floor because it does not translate well to a live action format and the first one being live action (when even the creators considered animating it) was treated as an investment in the future movies which they felt had to be live action (and of course bringing it closer to the real world would help sell tickets when they eventually made a theme park).</p>

<p> Harry’s character would specifically improved because A, you can make him look (and grow) exactly as described. You don’t have to hire a child who can act, and looks the part and bet on puberty being on your side. Just find a kid (or an adult/older kid) who can read the lines than have an artist bring him to life. You can have the messy black hair and green eyes and short skinny figure in adaptations 1-4 and have the lanky tall (but not as tall as his best friend) boy for adaptations 5-7. You can have it all. And you can have control over the physical manifestations of his emotions (something crucial to the stories, and something child actors notoriously struggle with). Mirror of erised scene quote “” the longing and hunger in his voice and face is absolutely missing from the films. Contributed to by the fact that he doesn’t look much like his parents. You can animate them to look exactly as similar as you’d like. Harry can have Lilly’s very eyes and James can look just like harry but a little older and with slightly sharper features. It’s crucial to remember that animators are acting, essentially, as cinematographers and have infinite control over every frame. Harry needs to be young. You can’t have an actor any older than he is and, even if you start right, he will slowly slip away and become and adult far too quickly. You loose the tragedy when he isn’t so young. Some argue that they won’t feel dark or tragic enough if it is animated. I would argue that you don’t. Having an increases suspension of disbelief allows you to full y immerse yourself in the story and when Harry, cartoon, animated, not-a-real-person, harry is in danger you let yourself feel his pain because you’ve allowed yourself to believe, you’ve suspended your disbelief in a way that a live action movie wont allow because, subliminally, you expect things to behave in a way that they simply aren’t. The filmmakers took many of these unexpected elements out of the stories to aid in this...but than you loose what makes Harry Potter, Harry Potter.</p>

<p>You end up with a WWII movie instead of a story about a boy who discovers that he is a wizard. Also it’s cheaper to have an actor repeat lines when it is for a voice over rathe than on film. More opportunities to get it perfect. The second rendition of Harry Potter is gaurentied to be better because the books have all been written now too sooo. Harry turns teachers wig blue Harry sets boa on Dudley Vernon’s cartoonish appearance Owls swooping downMcgonical tranformatioun Dumbledores aesthetic Harry v quirell sceneAlter the dimensions of the space slightly without it being glaringly obvious (as with love action) to heighten certain moments. i.e. harry with mirror highten the closeness between him and the mirror as he presses himself to his family but also heighten the space between his real self and the reflected self with his mother in reach. You cant do that with a live action moment. With animation it’s possible. Infuse magic in EVERY frame. Throguth diogon alley parents are acio-ign children to their side, a man is magic juggling with a collecting tin, the magic can whimsical and not just random colored liquid light bullshit. People are levitating their shopping list. Mothers using magic to separate fighting children. IT DOESNT COST MUCH MORE TO DO THIS WITH ANIMATRION SO THE STUDIO WONT TURN IT DOWN.</p> 

<p>The magic is sort of goofy throughout this book and it would look objectively better if it were animated. I would argue that it should be a 10 episode series of 22 minute episodes. Episode length carries genre implications. 22 minutes is children’s entertainment and comedies. The book doesn’t sustain multiple longer installments and this length would complement the narrative. You could focus on subplots for an episode and then return to the main plot. The story could breath. American film makers a scared of silence. We would get over that and let the story take its time and have a chance to breath. The animation could be simpler... or at least not as intricate as later. There wouldn’t be sweeping dynamic shots. It would feel like a children’s mystery but a little grittier and more sophisticated. Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone is perhaps the most blatantly cartoonish of the series. Notoriously, the series grew with the reader. The final books are longer, darker in content and far more complex and intricate, designed for an older, more mature reader. The target audience, throughout all seven books, is a reader of Harry’s age. So, The Philosopher’s Stone; with preteen protagonists, a Scooby Soo-style storyline and plot twist, and a relatively low-stakes adventure; is squarely a piece of children’s literature. Though the series as a whole deals with mature themes of injustice, found family, death and loss, and the first installment does not shy away from these elements, Harry, and the reader, do not face the harsher ones head on and the narrative as a whole is much lighter in tone than the later ones. It is much like Charlotte’s Web. Through the course of the story, main character faces the fear of his own demise, and witnesses or comes to term with the death of a loved one. Harry can have green eyes, messy grey hair, look like his father, have knobby knees cartoonishly large clothes. He is snarky but also a truly good character...like his mother, and that is a fine line to toe and a very difficult thing to portray. Child actors, generally, struggle a lot with that sort of nuance. If half of the acting burden is placed on animators who are experts, as artists often are, at expressing complex emotional paradoxes it will greatly improve Harry’s portrayal.</p>
