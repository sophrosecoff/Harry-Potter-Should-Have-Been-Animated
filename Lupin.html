<p>Book: Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban , Character: Harry Potter.</p>

<p>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban breaks the mold of the previous books by providing a plot that is less straight forward and a resolution that is less clean. The characters in Prisoner of Azkaban are more complicated and the boundary between good and bad becomes less clear. Harry’s opinion about Sirius and Remus in particular evolves over the course of the story. Throughout the first half of the book Harry grows close with Professor Lupin as he grows to hate Sirius. The climax sees him distrusting both of them and the resolution has them slip from Harry just as he understands them each fully. </p>

<p>Lupin is Harry’s first real tie to his parents and to the life he could have had. His relationship with Lupin is inherently melancholy. Lupin is a sanctuary for Harry. He provides Harry with fleeting moments from his time with Harry’s father. But describing for Harry those that he lost describes the loss as well. With Lupin, Harry’s old pain and longing is more alive than ever. This theme is brought to the forefront of the story through the dementors. The demeanors are a literal manifestation of the darkness Harry has faced. They present to him the hardest moment of Harry’s life: witnessing his parent’s death. But this memory is one of the few that Harry has of his family and so he is morbidly drawn to it.</p>

<p>The way the dementors appear on screen is important for these moments to appear effective. They must meld seamlessly into the world of the story, feel as though they, not just belong, but sprang into being within it. In a live action setting CGI or practical effects would be used. CGI, no matter the quality of the effect, will always appear plastered onto the real components of the scene. A practical effect (such as a puppetry or something similar) would look like an imitation of what was described in the books and would, therefore, loose some of the respect of the viewer. With animation the Dementors would align with the aesthetic of the world as presented on screen because they would be designed together, each with the other in mind.</p>

<p>Lupin’s presentation on screen is also important. The primary descriptor that is used by the narrator for Lupin is stating that his face is “prematurely lined”. It is hard to find an actor that looks the part. He must look young but have the specific features of a much older man. Graying hair, creases in his cheeks, a tired stance. But still, he must look like the young man that he is. Unlike Dumbledore, who looks old but feels youthful, Lupin feels old but looks young despite his features that speak to the contrary.</p>

<p>Lupin is also described as being scarred. His life as a werewolf has worn on his skin. But these are not all old wounds. The scars on his face and back must be a cobbled web of ancient pain and fresh injuries, slick with blood. In live action this would come across as gory which may detract from the quiet severity of his situation. In animation it would contribute to his aesthetic without drawing direct attention unless warranted. As an aside, animation would enable flexibility in the character design of Remus and the other Marauders that could enhance the themes associated with their characters. Lupin the werewolf with flesh cratered like the full moon, Sirius, named after a star, with eyes as dark and expansive as the twinkling sky, James shining bright as the sun and Lilly with imagery associated with the earth, hearth and home in her wake.</p>
    
<p>There are also practical reasons why Remus’s character is best suited for animation. The primary plot point associated with him is his lycanthropy. Lupin’s transformation into a werewolf in the film left much to be desired for many of the same reasons as the dementors. Even though modern special effects are much more advanced than those used in the Harry Potter films, it would still arguably detract from the plot. With CGI we are capable of making fantastical situations look as close to how they would appear were they to actually occur. The issue is, a more realistic effect does not inherently force the audience to suspend their disbelief. Generally, the more realistic something appears, the more realistic we expect it to behave. Any behavior that deviates from the expected (i.e. a man turning into a wolf) acts as a distraction from the importance of the scene. Werewolf transformations are well within the norm for cartoon characters and, therefore, the audience would not withdraw their attention from the emotion of what is occurring on screen. With animation, the filmmakers would also be able to imbed the image of a wolf within the visual world surrounding Lupin. When Harry begins to distrust him, the shadow of the wolf would appear across Lupin’s face. This could be reiterated in Deathly Hallows when Lupin gives in to his cowardice and abandons his wife and son. </p>

<p>Animation is, practically, the correct choice of medium for Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. As a medium, animation provides flexibility while maintaining a cohesive aesthetic. In addition it enables the audience to witness the outlandish events of the story without second guessing them unless that is the intent of the scene.</p>
