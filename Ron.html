<blockquote>“‘Yeah, well, food's one of the five exceptions to Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfigurations,’ said Ron, to general astonishment.”</blockquote>

<p>Book: Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Character: Ron Weasley.</p>

<p>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is tonally similar to the first book in the series. It is dark in places but relatively light hearted overall. The charming and vibrant opening chapters warrant a charming and vibrant adaption. Ron Fred and George rescuing Harry from his Aunt and Uncle’s house by flying a car to his bedroom window is about as cartoony an antic as it is possible to be. The Weasley’s topsy-turvy country home is shown for the first time. It serves as a distillation of the Weasley family’s character with its many rooms and stories all cobbled together haphazardly and the warm and welcoming colors and decor. It becomes Harry’s home away from hogwarts, a place where he is not only important to the world but to the people around him. Only an animated format could do Harry’s stay at the burrow justice. The magical chores they partake in and the whimsy of their surroundings. When Harry arrive at Hogwarts by crashing the flying Ford Anglia into a tree that fights back, animation would suit the story better than any alternative. And when they attend classes to find Defense against the Dark Arts is taught by an over-the-top narcissist, though Kenneth Branagh performed the role valiantly, animators could work to heighten the distinction between gilded Gilderoy and the historic Hogwarts.  As the book continues and Harry Blue-scadoos into Voldemort’s diary and, later, fights both the memory of young Tom having emerged from the diary into a corporeal form and the accompanying giant serpent, it would be inherent to the animated medium for the audience’s disbelief to be suspended allowing the relative absurdity of the plot to go unnoticed, or at the very least it would not distract the audience and detract from the story that is actually being told, one of character, not circumstance.</p>

<p>Before the release of the films Ron was a favorite of many Harry Potter fans. His wit, charm and relatable, characteristic incompetence in certain contexts make him one of the most endearing characters that takes center stage throughout the series. The movies made several key changes to his character that reduced him to comic relief and relationship drama. In the books he was Harry’s primary source for knowledge about the culture of the wizarding world. Where Hermione is an expert on history, politics and facts; Ron is a beacon of information on all of the things that can only be gleaned through being brought up surrounded by wizarding culture. In the movies, much of this is syphoned off to Hermione. For example the films have Hermione, rather than Ron, define mudblood for both Harry and the viewer. Hermione is confined to being just ‘the smart one’ and Ron is revoked of his key role in the story. Beyond that it simply makes more sense that Hermione be ignorant of the term. Generally, school library books do not provide students with in-depth knowledge of slurs and their implications.</p>

<p>It is not difficult to improve upon Ron’s characterization in the films. Adhering more closely to his role in the books, using specific dialogue snatches or just respecting the spirit of his character, would make a hypothetical cinematic Ronald leagues ahead of the one that ended up on screen. But there will always be things that are lost in translation when the goal is solely to replicate a text on screen. 
    One of the most powerful components of animation as a medium is its unending capacity for manipulation. Animators act as character designers and landscape artists but also as cinematographers and editors. But they are cinematographers and editors with a thousand more tools at their disposal than those perusing live action. Not only can they manipulate the setting and characters in ways that are impossible to do with actual human beings and physical sets, but they can adjust the lighting and colors to a much more significant degree than live action filmmakers can. Stronger and bolder choices will not negatively effect the films watchability but, instead, contribute to a subtle sense of an intended message. One of the most captivating characteristics of animation is that it is a modern iteration on an art form that has been practiced for all of human history. People have been drawing and painting since the dawn of man. Thus, animation is inherently steeped with culture and character. Just the style of an animated work in and of itself tells a story. In live action movies costumes and sets can work to provide a similar note to the piece, but animation can go much, much further. </p>

<p>Although Ron is a key contributor to the strategy of the golden trio, his primary role in the story is to provide sanctuary for Harry and Hermione. He is Harry’s first friend and his family becomes Harry’s. He is Hermione’s foil and complement. Ron was Harry’s First home, and Hermione found her last home with him. Ron welcomed Harry into his family even though Harry encapsulates all of Ron’s deepest envies. He has wealth and noterietay. Ron is poor and one of many. Still he sees a scared little boy with all that he has ever wanted and gives him what he see’s that Harry is missing: a family. Throughout the series when Ron is fighting with Harry it alters the tone of story until they are speaking again. When Ron abandons Harry (in goblet of fire, or in Deathly Hallows) it is such a major moment for his character because he, momentarily, fails at the thing that most defines him: loyalty. In order for the full impact of Ron’s loyalty and betrayal to make it on the screen the totality of his commitment to, and effect on, his friends needs to be utterly apparent that way when he is missing the absence is made plain. In a live action rendition this is entirely dependent on the actors. With animation there are a thousand techniques that can work in congress to produce this effect. The artists can assign a certain color palette to accompany Ron when he is on screen. Lay a warm hue over the frames that see the trio together and whole. Adorn the spaces that Ron occupies with reds, maroons and oranges. The Gryffindor common room, the burrow and the Hogwarts express can all maintain this aesthetic. All of the places that Harry finds home and comfort in should be laced with Ron’s presence. When Ron and Harry are not speaking the temperature of the scene can cool reflecting the loss of Ron’s warmth. The places that Harry visits without Ron: the Hogwarts grounds, the library and Hagrid’s cabin, can be painted with blues, greens and cool browns: colors that are not inherently miserable but are cold and empty without Ron’s fiery warmth. Fire, a symbol of rage contempt and anger, also encapsulates hearth, home and intimacy just like Ron. </p>

<p>Ron is such an interesting character because he is comprised of a combination of both domesticity and toxic masculinity. The bulk of his arch as a character concerns this dichotomy. He watches his strong and successful older brothers and sees himself, unable to excel in the same ways that they do. It takes the series for him to come to terms with his own character and to find the strength in those qualities of which he is comprised. He feels that he needs to be a better man to deserve Hermione but, in the end, she lets herself love him when he succumbs to a moment of compassion. Ron is ultimately much more like his mother. Strong willed, wicked angry at times but mostly just full of love and a commitment to make the world more comfortable for those around them.</p>

<p>This dichotomy can manifest on screen if Ron is animated with warm colors, soft angles and curves, and the use of floral and natural imagery in the patterns that accompany him. When he is on screen and fully himself he radiates warmth and color, his silhouette is comprised of soft forms and the clothes he wears are textured with faint embroidered leaves and flowers (this could be reflected in what Molly wears as well). This, paired with the toxic anger and frustration he exhibits throughout the series, would be a physical juxtaposition only possible through animation that would demonstrate so much of his struggle and growth throughout the series. </p>
