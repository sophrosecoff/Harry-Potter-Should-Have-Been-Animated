<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Over the past decade the cinematic industry has pushed the boundaries of what is possible on screen more than ever before. Technologies are better (and continuing to improve) and budgets are larger. Audience’s are also receiving more content from more places than at any point in the past. Despite the growth in the film industry movies are not actually getting better. We, as a community, are creating technically flawless pieces fo cinema however, the emphasis, in a lot of cases, has been removed from the individual artist. When the goal is to be visually impressive and technologically miraculous, the creators stop looking at the specifics of what they are creating and what visuals would best suite the story. 
    
<p>When adapting a piece of literature the goal should always be to improve it. This isn’t to say that it will be a replacement of the text but it should always work to improve portions of the piece of the work it is a adapting and, in turn,  make little sacrifices. The goal should never just be to get to see the book on screen. This is a mistake that is often made. The people who adapt works to film forget to respect film as a medium in and of itself. You must be both be a fan of literature and cinema. You have to love and understand both. The act of bringing a beloved work to life is, alone, not enough. The artist must understand and use the areas where their medium excels to best adapt the work. Internal monologues and being tied to one character are unavoidable losses when going form reading to witnessing but there is the potential to make up for that. Often filmmakers sacrifice a thousand things, leaving the world of the piece of literature worse than when they found it. We are accustom to hearing “the book is always better than the movie” but this does not necessarily have to be true. This implies that literature is an inherently superior medium. There are some stories that can be told in only one format but many others that have capacity to work well on screen and on the page.</p>

<p>The Harry Potter series is a perfect example of this. The films left out many of the individual moments that make the books so fun and engaging and emotional but, perhaps more importantly, they also abandoned the spirit of the story in many instances. The primary issue with the Harry Potter films is that they simply did not have enough time to explore the books in depth. This could be resolved by adapting the Harry Potter books to a television series with one season per book, or the filmmakers  could simply readjust their priorities and allocate the precious minutes on screen differently. </p>

<p>The more pressing issue with the Harry Potter films is that they tried to force too much grit into places that did not need it. The palette they used was dull for the later films and the film stylings, in general, were over dramatic. Part of the charm of the Harry Potter series is the juxtaposition between misery and injustices the characters face, and the whimsy of the world it takes place in. The filmmakers made the mistake of thinking that the exclusion of the most colorful and eccentric parts of the books would enable the audience to better empathize with the characters. They made their suffering look like ours. The issue is that Harry Potter concerns magic. When working in this context  making the aesthetic similar to our world causes the surreal moments to stand out against the familiar aesthetic rather than fade into and meld with the world the artist is trying to build. This is an issue is essentially resolved if the medium used were to be switched to animation.</p>

<p>Choosing to bring Harry into the ‘real wold’ has the benefit of allowing the audience to feel that the characters’ experiences are realer than ever and that we are closer to the magical world that so captivated us, the reader. But this sort of heightened experience is inherent to any visual medium. There are may merits exclusive to interpreting a story through text, but the world entering your sense is not one of them. By adapting a film to the screen, no matter the medium used, the story is brought to the audience’s eyes and ears. If the only reason that a book is  adapted to live action is to bring the story to the real world it is worth looking at what potential is abandoned by making that choice. With Harry Potter, so much is given up in that sole act.</p>

<p>Acclaimed filmmaker Steven Spielberg was considered as a director for the series during its early production and he encouraged Warner Bros. to peruse an animated adaption, stating that it would better demonstrate the magical components of the story. Ultimately, of course, Spielberg was set aside and the production of the blockbuster, live action series that has come to define much of the Harry Potter fandom commenced. Although it was nixed during the Harry Potter films’ preproduction, Animation is the best medium to bring the Harry Potter to the world of cinema. We as an audience have preconceived notions of what animated movies are supposed to be like and they does not necessarily align to our expectations of the Harry Potter series. But these preconceptions are simply a product of the media we currently have access to. Subversions of the exceptions of animation are used sparingly in most modern animated films. We expect goofy children’s fun. But animation, though it is often treated as one, is not a genre. It is simply a medium whose characteristics can often work to improve a story’s telling. Animation is often considered to be a medium designed exclusively for children. While this is simply untrue it as also irrelevant to this particular argument because Harry Potter is, first and foremost, a piece of children’s entertainment. Of course teens and adults everywhere read and love the series starting from book one but this does not mean that the series belongs to them. It is a mark of good storytelling that the book is not only enjoyable reading for any reader, but leaves a sophisticated impression on them no matter their age. The assumption that, because a book can be analyzed, dissected and admired by an adult audience, it must be adapted to an ‘adult’ medium both betrays a lack of understanding about what the job of the medium is and completely undervalues the worthiness of Harry’s first audience. </p>

<p>Animation doesn’t have to be simple cartoons like those on Cartoon Network (something lovely in their own right). It can be a sophisticated art form like many of the films that come out of Disney and Pixar’s theatrical releases, those produced by Cartoon Saloon, and any of studio Ghibli (and specifically Miyazaki)’s films. We trusted Harry to a company but he should always have been left in the care of artists who understand and respect him and whose choices would reflect that. The portrayal will never be exactly what you envisioned but it has the potential to be full and rich and complex and beautiful in a way that live action movies are often not. </p>

<p>When adapting a piece of literature for the screen it is important to understand the goal of doing so. Generally, the capacity for turning a profit is the most crucial consideration for filmmakers and, especially, studios perusing an adaption of a an already successful work. This series of articles will not be delving into the intricacies of the financial aspects of the production of the Harry Potter films but instead looking at the adaption itself and why, critically, animation would be an improvement.  The live action remakes of classic Disney films are widely considered to be inferior to the charming, emotional and beautiful animated originals, but they do not make any less money. Profit is not the only does not necessarily dictate quality.</p>

<p>When converting text to screen there will always be sacrifices but the result should always warrant them. The goal should never just be to bring the book to a visual medium for the sake of seeing the characters and plot ‘come to life’. The artists involved must find ways, small or large, to improve the text using qualities unique to the chosen medium. There are things that can only be conveyed through words but there are still others that require a visual art. Effective filmmaking pulls moments from between the words and puts them on the screen. In this way the books and the films could coexist and complement one another, each feeding off of the qualities that best suit each other. Each imperfect if not for the other.</p>
